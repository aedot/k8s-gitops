## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f4a1/512.gif" alt="üí°" width="20" height="20"> Overview

This is a repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This semi hyper-converged cluster operates on [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos), an immutable and ephemeral Linux distribution tailored for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). [Longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn) supplies my workloads with persistent block, object, and file storage.

There is a template at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): eBPF-based networking for my workloads.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to my routes.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [akeyless](https://github.com/akeylesslabs/helm-charts).
- [multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni): Multi-homed pod networking.
- [longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) monitors my **entire** repository for dependency updates, automatically creating a PR when updates are found. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ components    # Re-usable kustomize components
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Flux system configuration
```

### Networking

## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f30e/512.gif" alt="üåé" width="20" height="20"> DNS

In my cluster there are two instances of [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) running. One for syncing private DNS records to my `UDM Pro Max` using [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), while another instance syncs public DNS to `Cloudflare`. This setup is managed by creating routes with two specific gatways: `internal` for private DNS and `external` for public DNS. The `external-dns` instances then syncs the DNS records to their respective platforms accordingly.

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template).

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
